Using The Dataset Explorer
==========================

### Overview

You can use this simple application to explore datasets from the R's **datasets** package by choosing which variables to show in a plot with pairwise relations between those variables.

### Using the program

There are several datasets available for exploring, please choose one of them by clicking on a corresponding dataset name in the **Choose Dataset** dropdown list. After choosing the dataset, you will see all of its variables in the **Available Variables** section where you can check the ones you want to be shown in pairwise relations plot. Finally, click the **Plot Selected Variables** button to draw the plot. If you choose no variables, no plot will be shown.

### Reading the plot

The plot may consist of a single rectangular area if one or two variables have been chosen or of several areas when there are more variables. Each area shows individual data points plotted by one variable vs. another. In case there are several areas, you can figure out which two variables are used in each area by looking at variable names in a corresponding row and a corresponding column -- the variable shown in the row is plotted on a vertical axis of the area, and the variable shown in the column is plotted on a horizontal axis.
